You are an adventurer in a dangerous world of wild monsters, hidden traps, secret ruins, and priceless treasures. But as you strike out into the world, what kind of adventurer will you be?

Do you throw yourself into the heat of battle, trusting in sword and shield to keep danger at bay? Do you use skill and cunning to outsmart and outmaneuver the enemy? Or do you dabble in arcane powers, twisting the very fabric of reality to suit your agenda?

Whatever your passion, Giffyglyph's Class Compendium introduces new mechanics, features, and subclasses for your D&D 5e character. Add new 1st-10th level options to your campaign and head out into adventure.
